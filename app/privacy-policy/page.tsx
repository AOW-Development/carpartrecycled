                information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient,
                and customized experience while using the Site. The Online Store

                <strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> This
                refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you
                are. Personal information is requested when you order a product
                or service, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and
                correspond with us. This information may include contact
                information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number
                and e-mail address. With this information, we can fill your
                service and product orders and better provide you with
                personalized services.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> This
                refers to information that does not by itself identify a
                specific individual. We obtain certain information about you
                based upon where you shop on the Site in various ways. This
                information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an
                aggregated basis. This information is compiled and analyzed on
                both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information might
                include the Website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you
                just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are
                using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the
                global address of documents and other resources on the World
                Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or
                device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
                ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the
                TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of
                the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that
                is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are
                surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify
                your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users
                to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

                should first confirm that our partner's privacy policy is
                acceptable to you because once your data is released, we would

                From time to time, we may be required by law enforcement or
                judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable

                disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a
                court order, legal process, warrant or subpoena or to cooperate
                with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with
                law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our
                services for illegal activities. As expressed in the Terms and

                We employ the industry-recognized information technology to
                protect the security of the information you submit to us. The
                importance of security for all Personally Identifiable
                Information associated with our customers is of utmost concern
                to us. Our secure servers protect the information using advanced
                encryption and firewall technology. We use Secure Socket Layer
                (SSL) technology for mutual authentication, data encryption and
                data integrity – all to ensure secure transactions for our
                customers. SSL is the industry standard security protocol to
                encode sensitive information, such as your credit card number.
              </p>
              <p>
                To most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and
                order fulfillment are handled by established third party
                banking, process agents and distribution institutions. They
                receive the information they need to verify and authorize your
                credit card transactions and to ship your order. When collecting
                credit card information for online purchases, we offer
                secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in
                transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it.
                When you access your account information, the information is
                kept on a secure server. Furthermore, all of the customer data
                we collect is protected against unauthorized access by physical
                security means.
